This code shows an generated, never ending, random and organic animation on the led-panel of the IKEA Frekvens lamp.
It is using the noise-generation of the FastLED library to generate the pattern.
The pattern is then mirrored 3 times, to have some kind of kaleidoscope effect.

See https://youtu.be/j3RFZMUZXFc

The buttons change the brightness and the parameters for generating the noise-pattern.
Using the easyButton library for the buttons.

I used a Arduino Nano for this.

Using the great work of @frumperino: https://github.com/frumperino/FrekvensPanel
Could not have done it without this.
